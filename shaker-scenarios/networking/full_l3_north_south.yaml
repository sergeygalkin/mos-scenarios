description:
  This scenario launches pairs of VMs on different compute nodes. VMs are in
  the different networks connected via different routers, master accesses slave
  by floating ip

deployment:
  template: l3_north_south.hot
  vm_accommodation: [pair, single_room]

execution:
  progression: quadratic
